# AltiDuoMini
Firmware for the AltiDuo Mini altimeter using an ATtiny 84  microcontroller
This is another version of the Alti Duo that is using an Attiny 84 processor. It is smaller than the other AltiDuo that is using an ATMega 328. However unlike the big AltiDuo it cannot connect to the USB port so to program it you have to remove the ship.
